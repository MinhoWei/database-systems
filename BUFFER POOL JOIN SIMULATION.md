# Buffer Replacement Strategies
Buffer replacement strategies in Database Management Systems (DBMS) are crucial for managing the cache of disk blocks in memory. These strategies determine which blocks to remove from the buffer pool (a cache in the system's main memory) to make room for new blocks when the pool is full and a new block needs to be read from disk. Some common buffer replacement strategies:
 - **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: LRU is a popular strategy that removes the least recently used block from the buffer. The idea is that blocks accessed recently are more likely to be accessed again soon.
 - **Most Recently Used (MRU)**: Contrary to LRU, the MRU strategy removes the most recently used block.
